    <h1>This is a testy little test</h1>

    <p>The Detroit Tigers won just 77 games in 2021, but taken in context, the season was a rousing success. Some much-hyped young players began to contribute in the big leagues, the impact of new manager A.J. Hinch was easy to see, and the humble win total represented the club’s high water mark over the last five years. The Tigers aren’t good yet, but they’ve taken the essential and quite difficult step of going from being a club that is constantly re-tooling to one on its way. Now it’s time to take that next step toward actual contention.</p>
    
    <p>Most of Detroit’s progress in 2021 came on the pitching side, as the offense finished 11th in the American League in runs scored. But while the Tigers system isn’t exceptionally deep, it does feature a duo of 60 FV offensive prospects in first baseman Spencer Torkelson and outfielder Riley Greene, who are not only quite good, but also quite close to making their debuts in Motown after finishing the year with successful runs at Triple-A Toledo. If both can reach their potential (far easier said than done), the middle of the Tigers lineup will be transformed. Those two alone could end up producing as much as some systems will in their entirety.</p>
